This singsparrow software is a new version of the [SingSparrow](https://github.com/crodriguez-saltos/SingSparrow) software originally written by Carlos Rodr√≠guez-Saltos for operant conditioning in the [Maney Lab](https://www.birdbrainlab.org). Some of the methods in the singsparrow.py file are based off of work done by [Evan Goode](https://github.com/evan-goode/singsparrow-ii) on improving SingSparrow. This software is written in Python for use on the Raspberry Pi. It includes an interactive controller program that allows the user to manipulate and set different variables in the experiment. These variables are then written to a configuration file singsparrow.conf which the program singsparrow.py reads and runs. Additionally, it includes some data analysis software.
